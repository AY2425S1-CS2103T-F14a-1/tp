## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="800" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add a new student


The add command is used to add a new student to the address book. The `AddCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating an `AddCommand` object. The `AddCommand` object is then executed by the `Logic` component.

`AddCommandParser` obtains the values corresponding to the prefixes `n/` `p/` `e/` `a/` `t/` `s/` `r/` `paid/` `owed/` from the user input. The `AddCommandParser` will enforce the following constraints:
* There is no preamble text between the `add` command word and the prefixes.
* The prefixes `n/` `p/` `e/` `a/` `t/` `s/` `r/` must be provided (`paid/` and `owed/` are optional).
* If the prefixes are provided, they must appear for only once.
* All values corresponding to the prefixes that are provided must be non-empty and valid.

If the constraints are not met, the `AddCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` with an error message indicating the constraint that was violated.
Otherwise, a new instance of `Student` is created with the values obtained from the user input. 
A new instance of `AddCommand` is then created with the `Student` instance.

On execution, `AddCommand` first queries the supplied model if it contains a student with both an identical name **and** an identical phone number. If no such student exists, `AddCommand` then calls on `model::addStudent` to add the student into the addressBook data.

Finally, `AddCommand` queries the model to see if the student's schedule clashes with others in the address book. If conflicts are found, a warning message is displayed along with the conflicting students.

Below is an activity diagram when [Adding a new student](#add-a-new-student)

<puml src="diagrams/AddCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddCommandActivityDiagram"/>


The following sequence diagram shows how an add operation goes through the `Logic` component:
<puml src="diagrams/ParseArgsToGetStudentFieldReferenceFrame.puml" alt="ParseArgsToGetStudentFieldReferenceFrame"/>
<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an AddCommand operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram-Model" height="500"/>



#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How add command is carried out:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Key in all the details for student in one command.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, as only one command needs to be key in by user.
  * Cons: Command might get too long.

* **Alternative 2:** Key in the details for students in multiple steps.
  * Pros: A step-by-step guide for adding details can be especially helpful for new users, as it offers clear and structured guidance.
  * Cons: It is hard to implement, especially with a mix of optional and compulsory fields. 
  Additionally, it is not user-friendly for fast typists, as multiline commands are required to add a student.


### Owe tuition fees

The owe command is part of UGTeach's payment tracking feature. It is used to track the amount of tuition fee owed by a student. The `OweCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating an `OweCommand` object. The `OweCommand` object is then executed by the `Logic` component.

`OweCommandParser` obtains the `INDEX` of the student and the values corresponding to the prefix `hr/` from the user input. The `OweCommandParser` will enforce the following constraints:
* The `INDEX` must be a positive integer.
* The prefix `hr/` must be provided.
* If the prefixes are provided, they must appear for only once.
* Value corresponding to the prefix that is provided must be non-empty and valid (positive multiple of 0.5).

If the constraints are not met, the `OweCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` with an error message indicating the constraint that was violated.
Otherwise, a new instance of `OweCommand` is then created with the values of `INDEX` and `HOURS_OWED` parsed by `OweCommandParser`.

On execution, `OweCommand` first queries the supplied model for the student to be updated using the `INDEX`. 

Then, `OweCommand` calculates the amount of tuition fee owed and checks if the total amount owed by the student exceeds the limit of `9999999.99`. If it exceeds, `OweCommand` will throw a `CommandException` with an error message indicating that limit was violated.

Finally, `OweCommand` updates the total amount of tuition fee owed by the student by creating a new `Student` instance with updated fields to replace the outdated `Student` instance in the model.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to track payment after a lesson:
<puml src="diagrams/PaymentTrackingActivityDiagram.puml" width="750"/>

How an OweCommand operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/OweSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="OweSequenceDiagram-Model" height="1400" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How owe executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculations for amount owed done by UGTeach.
    * Pros: User friendly.
    * Cons: May have performance issues due to the need to fetch data and perform calculations.

* **Alternative 2:** Calculations for amount owed done by the user.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Might not be user-friendly as user would need to find out what is the 
    tuition rate charged and calculate how much tuition fee did the student owe.
